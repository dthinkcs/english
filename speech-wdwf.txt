11 INT. BOTTOM OF THE OLD WELL -- DAY (WAYNE’S MEMORY)
Silence. Young Bruce lies there, exhausted, weeping softly.

                MALE VOICE:
        Bruce?
        It's okay. It's okay.


Young Bruce looks up: a FIGURE, long coat billowing, is
lowered down the shaft... THOMAS WAYNE, Young Bruce’s
father.

12 EXT. GARDENS, WAYNE MANOR -- MOMENTS LATER 
Thomas carries his son towards the house. At his side, a 50-
year-old man in a somber suit calmly coils a rope: ALFRED.

                ALFRED
        Will we be needing an ambulance,
        Master Wayne?

                THOMAS
        We have everything I need to set
        the bone. I’ll take him for x-rays
        later.

                ALFRED
        Very good, sir.

13 INT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR -- CONTINUOUS 13
Thomas carries Bruce up the main stairs. The house is vast
and grand, but full of flowers and life. Bruce’s Mother
(MARTHA) appears at the landing, distraught.
                
                THOMAS
        (reassuring)
        He’ll be fine.

                ALFRED
        Took quite a fall, didn’t we?

Young Bruce looks up at Alfred. Manages a slight smile.

                THOMAS
        And why do we fall?

Young Bruce says nothing.

                THOMAS
        So we can learn to pick ourselves up.


Alfred smiles gently. PULLS the curtains shut
