                          MARK (CONT'D)
           Question Two: "When you were stranded and
           alone up there... did you think you were
           gonna die?"
                         
          And there's a pause as Mark thinks about it. The rare moment
          of reflection for our hero.
                         
          He nods. Genuine:
                         
                          MARK (CONT'D)
           Yes.
                         
          Then...
                         
                          MARK (CONT'D)
           And it'll happen to you, too. You should
           know that going in. It's space. It's
           filled with chance, circumstance, and bad
           luck. It doesn't cooperate. At some
           point, I promise, at some point every
           single thing is gonna go south on you,
           and you'll think: this is it. This is
           how I end.
                          (THEN)
           And you can either accept that... or you
           can get to work.
                         
          He lets those words land.
                         
                          MARK (CONT'D)
           That's all it is. You simply begin.
           Solve one problem. Then the next one,
           then the next.
                          (THEN)
           You solve enough problems... and you get
           to come home.
