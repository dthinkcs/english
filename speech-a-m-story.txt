NICOLE
Henry’s teacher wants to meet with us.

CHARLIE
You mean his LA teacher--

NICOLE
Can you respond to the email
so we can set a time?

CHARLIE
Yeah, I’ve been distracted.

NICOLE
I understand. They just want to
rule out everything, you know,
with his reading.

CHARLIE
I think he’s just over-anxious. I
think he wants it so much.

NICOLE
I know, he quits too easily
if things aren’t easy for
him. You know, he’s like
us, he’s stubborn.

CHARLIE
They said he’s off the
charts in math.

NICOLE
He’s still a lousy Monopoly player
because he tries to save all his
money.

Charlie laughs. Nicole smiles.
