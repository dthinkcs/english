Gordon steps out. The overhead lights COME ON. BATMAN IS 
BEHIND HIM. The Joker BLINKS in the HARSH WHITE LIGHT. 


WHAM! The Joker's face HITS the table- comes up for air— 
CRACK! CRACK 1 To the head. Batman is in front of him. 
The Joker stares, fascinated. Bleeding. 

THE JOKER 

Never start with the head... victim 
gets fuzzy. Can’t feel the next- 

CRACK! Batman's fist SMACKS down on the Joker’s fingers. 

THE JOKER (CONT'D) 

(calm) 

See? 


BATMAN 

You wanted me. Here I am. 

THE JOKER 

I wanted to see what you'd do. And 
you didn't disappoint... 

( laughs ) 

You let five people die. Then you 
let Dent take your place. Even to 
a guy like me... that's cold- 

BATMAN 

Where’s Dent? 

THE JOKER 

Those mob fools want you gone so 
they can get back to the way things 
were. But I know the truth- 
there’s no going back. You've 
changed things . Forever . 

BATMAN 

Then why do you want to kill me? 

The Joker starts LAUGHING. After a moment he's laughing so 
hard it sounds like SOBBING. 

THE JOKER 

Kill you? I don't want to kill 
you. What would I do without you? 

Go back to ripping off Mob dealers? 

No you . . . 

(points) 

You . Complete . Me . 



BATMAN 

You're garbage who kills for money. 

THE JOKER 

Don't talk like one of them- you're 
not, even if you'd like to be. To 
them you're a freak like me... they 
just need you right now. 

He regards Batman with something approaching pity. 

THE JOKER (CONT’D) 

But as soon as they don’t, they'll 
cast you out like a leper. 

The Joker looks into Batman’s eyes. Searching. 

THE JOKER (CONT'D) 

Their morals, their code... it’s a 
bad joke. Dropped at the first 
sign of trouble. They’re only as 
good as the world allows them to 
be. You'll see- I'll show you... 
when the chips are down, these 
civilized people... they’ll eat 
each other. 

(grins) 

See, I'm not a monster... I’m just 
ahead of the curve. 

Batman GRABS the Joker and pulls him upright.
