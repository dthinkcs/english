A man's destination is his own village, 
His own fire, and his wife's cooking; 
To sit in front of his own door at sunset 
And see his grandson, and his neighbour's grandson 
Playing in the dust together. 

Scarred but secure, he has many memories 
Which return at the hour of conversation, 
(The warm or the cool hour, according to the climate) 
Of foreign men, who fought in foreign places, 
Foreign to each other. 

A man's destination is not his destiny, 
Every country is home to one man 
And exile to another. Where a man dies bravely 
At one with his destiny, that soil is his. 
Let his village remember. 

This was not your land, or ours: but a village in the Midlands, 
And one in the Five Rivers, may have the same graveyard. 
Let those who go home tell the same story of you: 
Of action with a common purpose, action 
None the less fruitful if neither you nor we 
Know, until the judgement after death, 
What is the fruit of action.
