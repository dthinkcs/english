I'm asking for your help.

I believe there is a stranger who comes to this village from the sea.

He comes in the winter when the people are hungry and brings fish.

He comes on the king tide.

That was last night.

Icebergs in the harbor, four months since the last ship got through.

Well, this stranger doesn't come by ship.

There are enemies coming from far away.

I need warriors.

I'm building an alliance to defend ourselves.

Look, I'll give you $25,000 to talk to this man right now.

Outside.

Tell me what those three boxes are and I'll make it $30,000.

You should get out.

Can you at least point me to Atlantis?

Arthur Curry.

Also known as Protector of the Oceans.

The Aquaman.

I hear you can talk to fish.
